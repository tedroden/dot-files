# Ted Roden's various dotfiles

This is my collection of dotfiles. But it's really just my .emacs file. 

## .emacs

This sets up some sane (IMO) defaults and installs useful packages.

It allows for two special files:

1. `custom.el`: will store things set with `custom`
2. `personal.el`: We'll load this if it exists for things that don't belong in git. 

Let me know what you think.

The first time you run this, it will take a long time. It should be very fast after the first time. Let me know if something doesn't work.

## .xinitrc

This is pretty basic, probably not useful to anyone else.

## .xmodmap

~~This if for my [Chromebook Pixel](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BM7Y7DQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00BM7Y7DQ&linkCode=as2&tag=tedrodcom-20&linkId=SICDVA2IRDFKLAU3). All it does is change the `search` key into a control key.~~

## install.sh

I wouldn't use `install.sh` if I were  you.
