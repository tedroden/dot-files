2007-04-02  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner-el.texi (Planning based on the Franklin-Covey Approach):

	we're compatible with.

2007-02-10  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

2007-02-06  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner-el.texi (Task Detail): Clarification, see #8366.

	up in the customize interface for `planner-annotation-functions'.
	Thanks to Hadron Quark for the report.

	* planner-el.texi (Installing from a Source Archive): Mention
	creating an ~/elisp directory.  Also mention how to get Muse and
	Remember.  Mention running "make clean".
	(Installing from Arch): Document Remember archive usage.  Use "tla
	update", not "tla replay".
	(Installing from Debian): Mention remember-el.  Since I get asked
	this so frequently, mention how to make the warning message go
	away -- it's not an error!
	(Timeclock): Shift xref to end of sentence so makeinfo doesn't
	complain.
	(Getting Help): Change URL to the emacswiki.org one.  So long,
	plannerlove.  Thanks to Hadron Quark for pointing all this out.

2006-12-26  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	included in another file by means of Muse's new <include> tag,
	these transforms will still be applied.

2006-11-29  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner-publish.el (planner-publish-note-tag): Don't call
	planner-replace-regexp-in-string if either the text or the regexp
	are empty strings.  This should fix a bug with note publishing
	that XEmacs users were experiencing.  Thanks to Cumhur Erkut for
	the report.

2006-11-04  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner-el.texi (PSVN): Document all options and dependencies.

2006-10-20  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

2006-10-16  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner-authz.el (planner-authz-markup-tags): Adapt for nested
	tag support.

	* planner-notes-index.el: Use add-hook instead of add-to-list, in
	case muse-publish has not been loaded yet.  Use
	muse-publish-markup-tags instead of planner-markup-tags.

	* planner-publish.el (planner-publish-markup-tags): Adapt for
	nested tag support.  Make the <nested-section> tag nestable.

	* planner-timeclock.el: Use add-hook instead of add-to-list, in

	planner-timeclock-report-tag.

2006-09-26  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	beginning-of-line.  This should fix a bug that was noticed in
	recent Emacs 22 builds.

2006-09-23  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner-el.texi (Installing from Arch): Fix arch revision
	number.

2006-09-10  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner-zoom.el (planner-zoom-iup, planner-zoom-idown)
	(planner-zoom-inext, planner-zoom-iprev): Use planner-page-name
	instead of buffer-name.  This fixes a match-string error, and
	makes things work when you have muse-file-extension set to
	something.

2006-09-04  John Sullivan  <john@wjsullivan.net>

	* planner.el (planner-list-tasks-with-status): Fix doc string.

2006-08-12  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (.PHONY): Split long line.

	* AUTHORS: Bookkeeping.

	* contrib/schedule.el: Update header.

	* contrib/timeclock.el: Install Adrian's changes from 2006-08-01.

	Emacs, but with Planner instead.

2006-08-11  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* planner-calendar.el (planner-calendar-published-file-href): Fix
	potential error when the calendar for next month is empty.

	encrypted timeclock-file does not have to be opened on each
	clocking operation (requiring entry of encryption key).

	* timeclock.el (timeclock-log): Don't kill timeclock-file buffer.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-log-data): Use

	timeclock-file, if it's already in a live buffer.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-find-discrep): Ditto.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-visit-timelog): Ditto.

See ChangeLog.3 for earlier changes.
